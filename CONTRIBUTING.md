# Contributing to TechSomnia projects!
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GPL-3.0 Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [License](https://github.com/techsomnia/endtp/blob/main/LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/techsomnia/endtp/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/techsomnia/endtp/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
There will be a bug report template available when creating a bug report

Sample code is of course not *needed* since we do understand that not everybody even knows what is going wrong!

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
This makes reading and understanding it *so* much easier!

* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification

## License
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its GPL-3.0 License.
